# Implementing-core-Machine-Learning-models-to-predict-the-popularity-of-online-news-articles
This project aims to acquire a deep understanding of core machine learning models structure, their working and their training process by implementing them element by element without using any preimplemented framework such as pyTorch, TensorFlow or scikitlearn. To test the correctness of the implemented models the results are compared to the one
