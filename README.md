# Implementing core Machine Learning models to predict the popularity of online news articles

## Overview

This project aims to acquire a deep understanding of core machine learning models structure, their working and their training process by implementing them element by element without using any preimplemented framework such as pyTorch, TensorFlow or scikitlearn. To test the correctness of the implemented models the results are compared to the ones obtained with scikitlearn respective models.
The tasks to solve were:
 -regression (predicting the exact number of shares of the articles), evaluated via RMSE;
 -classification (high or low number of shares according to a threshold of 1400), evaluated via accuracy percentage metrics.


## Models



 The models used to solve these tasks were:

- **Regression**
  - Linear regression (no regularization)
  - Linear regression L1 regularization
  - Linear regression L2 regularization
  - Linear regression Elastic Net regularization
  - KNN
  - Neural Network
- **Classification**
  - Decision Tree
  - Linear regression with threshold
  - Linear regression L1 regularization with threshold
  - Linear regression L2 regularization with threshold
  - Linear regression Elastic Net regularization with threshold
  - Logistic regression
  - KNN
  - Neural Network
