# Implementing-core-Machine-Learning-models-to-predict-the-popularity-of-online-news-articles
This project aims to acquire a deep understanding of core machine learning models structure, their working and their training process by implementing them element by element without using any preimplemented framework such as pyTorch, TensorFlow or scikitlearn. To test the correctness of the implemented models the results are compared to the ones obtained with scikitlearn respective models.

The tasks to solve were:
 -regression (predicting the exact number of shares of the articles), evaluated via RMSE;
 -classification (high or low number of shares according to a threshold of 1400), evaluated via accuracy percentage metrics.

 The models used to solve these tasks were:
